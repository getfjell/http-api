This is a simple HTTP library.

## Why another HTTP library?

The Fjell project was looking for a way to interact with a REST API in a simple way that provided the ability to
make typed requests and responses.

## How do I install it?

`yarn add @fjell/http-api`

## What if I use npm?

We think the answer is `npm install @fjell/http-api`, but we're not sure because we (the project) use yarn.



## How does it compare to other HTTP libraries?

We don't know.  Why don't you compare them?  Really, we're not sure.  We're not even sure if this is a good HTTP library.  We're just trying to scratch our own itch.

## How do I participate in this project?

You can participate in this project by forking the repository and making a pull request.  You can also participate by reporting issues or suggesting features.  If you have a question, go ahead and ask it on the issue tracker.  The project that published this isn't particularly active, but we'll try to respond to issues and pull requests.
